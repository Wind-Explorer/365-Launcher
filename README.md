Description:
My first ever app

Details:
I have just started learning python, and I have decided to use the Microsoft's Office desktop app as a reference for my first project. My app is written in Python and the app is supposed to have buttons that launches the dedicated office apps when pressed, similar to the actual Office desktop app that is preinstalled on almost every Windows 10 computer. The ultimate goal is to get the user interface, written in Tkinter, to be as similar as the original desktop app as possible.
