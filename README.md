# 365 Launcher
A basic app providing a user interface to launch Microsoft Office applications

# Why this app
I've noticed the existence of a dedicated app on mobile platforms (Android and iOS) called [Office][1] that allows users to use all three Office apps from one place, hence the 365 Launcher is here to provide the same everything-in-one-place experience for the desktop users

# How to use
Source code is avaliable [here][2]. Simply paste the code into an empty text file on your desktop device and run with Python3

This piece of code is written in Python and uses minimal modules, meaning all you need is Python installed to get up and running.
